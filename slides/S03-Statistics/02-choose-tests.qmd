## Q1: Bivariate Vs Multivariable

- The first question we need to ask is whether we are dealing with **bivariate** analysis or **multivariable** analysis.

- **Bivariate analysis:** studying the relationship between two variables.
- For example:
  - Age and height
  - Type of treatment and complication
  - Gender and smoking
  - Smoking and coffee consumption

- **Multivariable (regression modelling/analysis):** studying the effect of multiple variables on an outcome variable.

- For example:
  - Effect of smoking, sex, coffee consumption on blood pressure.
  - Effect of smoking, sex, coffee consumption on having a heart attack.
